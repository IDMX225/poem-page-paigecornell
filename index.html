<h1> Trees</h1>

<p class="thick">I think that I shall never see
a poem lovely as a tree.</p>

<p class="thick">A tree whose hungry mouth is prest
against the earth's sweet flowing breast;</p>

<p class="thick">A tree that looks at God all day,
and lifts her leafy arms to pray;</p>

<p class="thick">A tree that may in Summer wear
a nest of robins in her hair;</p>

<p class="thick">Upon whose bosom snow has lain;
Who intimately lives with rain.</p>

<p class="thick">Poems are made by fools like me,
but only God can make a tree.</p>
